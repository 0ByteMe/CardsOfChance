More of a card fighting that 'plays itself' while you watch.

*Key Takeaways from this project*

- Getting comfortable with multiple lists and manipulating the data between them.

- Very familiar with Co-Routines now...In fact, the majority of functionality in this project came from Co-Routines even thought there is most likely a much better way of doing it. Something akin to turn based combat. It made me realize I was building something slightly more complex using simple tools on my belt, it became pretty tedius towards the end but that was the moment of teaching for me. That is to say, I used tons of Co-Routines to very tightly control timing on when every action should happen. I believe a turn based framework would cut down alot on the workflow.
