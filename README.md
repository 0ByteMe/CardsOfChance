# CardsOfChance
More of a card fighting that 'plays itself' while you watch.

*Key Takeaways from this project*

- Getting comfortable with multiple lists and manipulating the data between them.

- Very familiar with Co-Routines now...In fact, the majority of functionality in this project came from Co-Routines. It made me realize I was building something slightly more complex using a simple tool. That is to say, I used tons of Co-Routines to very tightly control timing on when every action should happen. This was very tedious. A turn based framework would cut down alot on the workflow and improve gameplay massively. So it was a needed lesson to be learned.
